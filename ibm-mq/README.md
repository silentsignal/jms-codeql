CodeQL - IBM MQ JMS Insecure Deserialization
============================================

CodeQL query to identify insecure uses of the `JMSMessage` instances of [IBM MQ](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibm-mq/articles/mq-downloads). 

An example sink is defined for [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/) - you probably want to tweak this for your target.
